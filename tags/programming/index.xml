      <description>Valuable code is such because it works. It truly doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how such code looks or under what standards or rules it was written. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, it&amp;rsquo;s trash. If it works, it adds value.
This is something that almost all programmers know. We should get this taught early in our journeys because we ought to solve problems by writing code. The satisfaction that a developer gets when she sees her program working as expected and how it actually solves a real problem is unexplainable (she can finally go to sleep).</description>

      <description>Awesome articles about the topic:
 SOLID Principles Around You    In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
 But when to apply SOLID? Ardalis recommends following the Pain Driven Development or PDD:
 Write code using the simplest techniques you know to get the problem solved. Trying to always apply all SOLID principles would result in a premature optimization of the application&amp;rsquo;s design.</description>

      <description>The four pillars of OOP are:
 Abstraction Encapsulation Inheritance Polymorphism  But before describing each, basic concepts of OOP are needed to understand.
Basic OOP Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures a software program into reusable pieces of code blueprints, which are called classes.
Class A class is a code template or blueprint that describes what an object is and what it does, by defining attributes to store data and implementing methods or behaviors to use that data.</description>

 A delegate encapsulates a method.
Actions System.Action is the standard library type for void delegates, methods that don&amp;rsquo;t return a value. By default it&amp;rsquo;s parameterless, but it can have parameters with generics.
Action action = () =&amp;gt; Console.WriteLine(&amp;#34;Action done.&amp;#34;); // invoked as method call action() Action done. // user-declared delegate, no parameters delegate void MyAction(); MyAction myAction = () =&amp;gt; Console.</description>

 Events enable a class or object (the publisher) to notify other classes or objects (the subscribers) when something occurs.
 The publisher determines when to raise an event. It can have multiple subscribers. The subscriber determines how to handle an event when it&amp;rsquo;s raised. It can be subscribed to multiple events.  System.</description>
