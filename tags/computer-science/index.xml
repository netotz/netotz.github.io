Specifically, my mentor and I are implementing heuristics for the $\alpha$-neighor $p$-center problem (ANPCP for short). Because the literature about it is scarce, we&amp;rsquo;ve been reading papers that use heuristic algorithms for similar problems, and trying to adapt them to the ANPCP. In this process, I found it interesting how some authors decompose the objective function of a problem and evaluate it step by step while, at the same time, applying a heuristic to the current solution.</description></item><item><title>Aristotle, Boole and Shannon</title><link>https://netotz.github.io/posts/aristotle-boole-shannon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://netotz.github.io/posts/aristotle-boole-shannon/</guid><description>The other day I started to watch Computer Science Crash Course on YouTube. The first two videos explain the early History of computers, starting from the abacus: humans needed to store quantities; up to the 1950s. They explain how technology stopped being mechanical thanks to relays and how it was improved with vaccum tubes and then with transistors. Each one of these innovations allowed for faster propagation of electrical signals.</description></item></channel></rss>
