The first two videos explain the early History of computers, starting from the abacus: humans needed to store quantities; up to the 1950s. They explain how technology stopped being mechanical thanks to relays and how it was improved with vaccum tubes and then with transistors. Each one of these innovations allowed for faster propagation of electrical signals.</description></item></channel></rss>
