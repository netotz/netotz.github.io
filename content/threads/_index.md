There are some topics that I prefer to write about in Twitter because I like the compact (to some degree tough) format of tweets.

Some of them are a summary of a post from this blog, some others are just Twitter threads.

- [Solving the halting problem using TypeScript](https://twitter.com/tcenetotz/status/1589486842478755841).

I had another Twitter account but it was suspended permanently for unknown reasons, Twitter Support never replied to my emails.

So, if you are Elon Musk and are reading this, please help me recover my old bookmarks, I had good threads saved there ðŸ˜ž
