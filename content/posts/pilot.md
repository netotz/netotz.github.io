It's been a few months since I wanted to start a programming blog,
mainly because I want to write about how I struggle with dumb stuff and how I solve it, if so.
To be honest now I feel lazy about writing but I feel like I'm in debt.
I've been saved lots of times by strange programmers in the Internet who decided to magnificently contribute to the whole humanity, by posting their solutions.
Although most of those high value solutions are in sites like Stack Overflow, I've visited several awesome blogs of fellow coders who have saved my ass.
Actually [it is encouraged to ask and answer your own question in Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/07/01/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/).

There will be posts of other topics anyways, for the sake of practicing writing skills, especially in English.
